title: Why I am taking ITM 352
date: 2021-08-30

I got my first taste of programming in my senior year of high school by enrolling in AP computer science. And to be honest, I wasn’t a huge fan. I was clueless the entire time, assignments never stopped, and I didn’t fully commit myself. I thought I would never program again. Fast forward a couple of years and I got another taste of programming while taking ICS 101. Initially, like before, I was indifferent; however, our last project is what reeled me in. We used vscode to create our own webpages, and I was enthralled in the process. This project taught me that programming is technical, a bit tedious, but is also creative and most importantly fun.
I enrolled in ITM 352 for three main reasons: first, the world and business alike are becoming more technologically advanced, and as such, I want to ensure that I keep up. Second, everywhere on the internet I’ve read says that Accounting and MIS is a great combo. And Lastly, I wanna test myself, work hard, and have fun.
